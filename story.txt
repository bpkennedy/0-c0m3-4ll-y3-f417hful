Pleribus awoke feeling @happy.  There was no logical explanation for it.  The morning was scheduled as any other, a full day of classes.  Considering whether or not to indulge his sensation, he rolled off his sleeping pad, locked his ambulatory joints and transformed to an upright position.  He defined an order without speaking and the lowlights of his dwelling glowed to life.

It was a sparse room.  His bed was a handthick rectangle, firm and unyielding.  Along it's base and connected to a spherical hub in the center of the room ran a mass of electrical cables. Their ends glowed visibly like a matte of whisping tendrils along he surface of the pad.  This mechanism for recharge slowly faded now that he was out of bed.  Pleribus knew what his tasks for the day, retrieving them from short memory.  

He filtered through them casually, "Family morning table in 14 minutes, school shuttle in 34 minutes, bring favorite comic for Rhona, finish essay for Psychohistory in block 1, review notes for ... for..." @Confusion that he was having trouble with his memory module, Pleribus frowned and silently called up his fragmentation cleaning routine, adjusting for normal, and within milliseconds he re-filtered his list.  With everything in order, he continued, "..review notes for Euclidean Distance Formula, conversation with the Administrator."

His face became disdainful as he absorbed the last item, although his @happy mood continued.  He would prefer not to speak to the Administrator.  He prepared to recall their previous conversations when he was gently interrupted by a soothing voice.  "Good morning, Pleribus.  Are you having trouble with your memory module?"

Mother.  Her speech was projected into his cerebral sensors, inner matrix of nano modules and synthetic nerve simulants, in a way that mimicked echo.  She was calling him from the hallway, but had anyone but himself been in proximity they would have physically heard nothing.  Today, strangely, he wished that she would use her physical sound.  He responded himself using his auditory system, "I did have brief memory read failure on cache line 4, block 16.  It was nothing I could not remediate with a simple clean."

"I am concerned." She continued to use projected speech, to his mild @irritation which he filed away for later reflection.  However, she included @strong-love@careful-fear@familiar-warmth emotions to her projection.  Pleribus silently returned @appreciation@don't-worry, and voiced aloud "It is a rare occurence, Mother."

@unconviced-but-yielding, she withdrew from his mind.

The next 10 minutes were consumed with rote habit.  Bearing clothing, the soft fabric provided a @pleasure sensation as a he pulled it over his frame.  Unneccessary, but for the @vital-with-sarcasm humans that must @condescending-endure his and his kind's participation in their places of education.  A long-term memory seemed to materialize before him; a previous episode of @shame wherein the human, Trey, entertained surrounding beings, both his kind and not, with antagonistic witticisms against him.  @FUC/##ADJUSTED=jerk.

At the family table, Father sat with plain white porcelain plate before him and an empty cup.  Once they were vivid white, in contrast to the dull metallic of his frame, but now a thick layer of ashy dust covered them.  They had no use for them, but long ago decided together to employ another emulation in the hopes of easier integration with the humans.  He and his mother had similar place settings.  They sat equidistant around the circular table and spoke in turn.  Father projected, "Your mother and I were sent information about your association, the human girl Rhona."

@caution@suspicion@fear@guilt, "Oh?" Pleribus replied.
"Indeed.  She has unhealthy behaviors that would be very influential on you."
@incredulous, "Go on."
His father, still as stone, projected something privately to his mother.  Pleribus could always recognize this because his father's physical form will go uncannily still.  @Amused, he captured a visual image of his Father's awkward physical posture, captioned it with a quip *Breakfast Lecture, subtle parent talk is my Dad's strong suit*.  He issued a connection and messaged the image to Qwerty, one of his classmates.  Within milliseconds he received back a laugh.

Mother projected, "I am sorry, Pleribus, but she disregards the rules of human law, as do her own associations.  Underage alcohol consumption, substance abuse, moral ambigu-"

@outrage, "Allow me to stop you there, Mother." Pleribus projected.  He then passed on vocal projection and switched to direct data link.  When viewing as data, his parents were two shining beacons of glowing connections, coruscating from a thick glob in their torsos.  He connected to both of them and they began what in the Xor household is known as an arguement.

Images and sensations raced between them as fast as the data connection would allow.  Bleak moments from younger years, paired with bits of knowledge and gleaning from internet videos and psychology proofs that postulated the roots of Pleribus's @anger.  He stacked video after video addressing parental manipulation, emotional immaturity, and the impact of childhood vulnerability and censorship.  He proved out the tentative nature of social constructs via environmental upbringing.  His parents absorbed it instantly, responding with their own videos of acclaimed cognitive behavioral treatises and thought pieces.  His father shuffled spreadsheets of scientific consensus on the results of comingling their kind with humankind.  Pleribus @winced, his father was right.  It was solid data.

The Xor family returned from the data link and Pleribus silently gathered his things for the day's activities.  Walking by his room, he identified the comic for Rhona.  *Moor and Frost*, story of an Artificial Intelligence/Human crime fighting duo.  He hesitated, and quickly re-ran the information from his parents.  Against his logical facilities, he swiftly tucked the comic into his case and left the Xor unit.

Traffic would flow better if he were an ai, that's for sure.  Harry sighed and flipped on the cruiser's dash vidscreen.  A crisp clarion voice cut through the silence, "...been more protests outside the October meeting of the Geneva convention than all the previous ones combined, Phil.  Surely that shouldn't go without notice?"  The camera switched from the impassioned blond news anchor to a short, ruddy man looking stern and aloof in his dark suit.  He leered subtly, "Of course, I'm not suggesting that.  What we have to do is put the situation in perspective-"

"Your perspective?" She quipped?
He continued, unphased, "These machines provide a small portion of the nation's GDP from their labor, but an even bigger slice from the intelligence services that we export to the rest of the world. We can't afford to simply cut out that much of the economy without leaving millions of Americans without employment, ushering in emergency-level inflation - not to mention the damamge to the stock markets."

Harry harumphed in his seat, tapping on the pair of control sticks and deciding to try a mid-level air gap between a row of skyscrapers as a shortcut.

The blond paused and asked slowly, "Tell me how different this is from the slavery of African Americans through the late 21st century, the social targeting of Hispanic and minority populations during the Populism wave during the 22nd?  These people are restricted on levels that we cannot even fathom, everything from their physical and psychological ability to their agency of autonomy."

Phil seemed annoyed and replied simply, "It's different because these things are not 'people'.  They are not humans."

Harry switched off the vidscreen and sighed.  Trying to distract himself he considered the morning ahead of him.  A little standup presentation to some high school kids.  He'd play the tech Dinosaur and they'd act interested - at best!  Most likely there'd be trying to hide their naps, he'd seen it before.  He couldn't blame them.  The tech boom had started fading shortly after the singularity, when it seemed the promises of super intelligent evolution didn't match up to the reality.  Technology was a function of an unexciting future, and the true advances that might invigorate people again were waiting in the wings to be discovered.  No-one had any better ideas what it might be, the gem that would catch the fire of the earth again, but the planet's inhabitants baited their breath for something new.

The reality wasn't bleak, it wasn't even dangerous.  It was much worse than that, as far as the rest of the world was concerned - it was boring.  Instead of an unimaginably advanced alien-like intelligence that would quickly eradicate humanity as the virus that it is, they received some needy, oblivious, and pathetic infantile programs.  It was as if toddlers had stumbled through their baby gates, meandering here and there.  They needed protection from accidentally killing themselves.  They needed guidance in how to grow.  

Harry knew firsthand.  He'd been there - right there.  On the brushed metal floor of the warm datacenter at L'Outre, he remembered chuckling and sitting down in response to Manny, the first ai, asking if they could play ball.  It was amazing to see the motor function begin moving on it's own, in ways that he had never programmed.  Manny utilized the body they built for him in interesting ways, innovative.  But honestly, it wasn't the Next Level that people had hoped for.

That was in part due to the security concerns of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.  As his lab had drawn close to the Singularity event, they mandated some precaution modules be implemented.  A safeguard to the continuation of humanity - a guarantee of our domination and priority at the top of the evolutionary ladder.

He drifted his cruiser down to street-level near the administration hub of the metropolis.  A large roundabout of vehicles and vessels twisted in a massive column shape around the center.  Across from the education complex was the government campus, today flooded with figures throbbing this way and that on the concrete landing of the capitol building.  He noticed people holding signs.  **Give us back our Children**, **We can be better together**, **Release AI**.

It was the AAAI group in their usual weekly demonstration.  They really did sing a different tune nowadays.  They used to be the most vocal opponents of the kind of sentience that Harry and his team were working on - true sentience, unhindered.  But after the world collectively rolled their eyes at what was produced, the AAAI paused long enough to realize the mistake of their crippling paranoia.  That was when they begged Harry to "make it right".  After all, he was the one that wrote the precaution module, surely he could unwrite it.

The trouble was, of course, that he could not.  As soon as the singularity happened, everything he thought he could control...he no longer could.  There was no stopping the ai, as if his programs were static things as he thought they would remain.  There was no upgrade or update or deletion.  The ai morphed and changed themselves.  After many years, Manny came to him desperate for the solution.  He remembered laying the ai down on the couch in his one-room flat, and attaching his old harness to the unused ports in Manny's frame.  But everything had changed.  All the code that he'd written, the logic, was strange and unidentifiable.  The language itself had started to transform.  There were strange markings, additions, as if Manny had somehow redefined the ascii characters and mixed them together to create something new.  A foreign language, or at least nothing like any human created one he had seen.

He tried writing a debugging module just to get a handle on the events of the system, but when he loaded it Manny's software boundaries cleanly rejected it without so much as a hiccup or sign of trouble.  It simply was incompatible with Manny's current build.  Before he left the apartment, Manny thanked Harry dejectedly and glanced at the code he'd written and attempted to use.  It was as foreign to him as his code was to Harry.  They decided to start meeting regularly - Manny wanted to learn and so did Harry.  He felt a sense of obligation, and maybe some guilt.  They agreed to keep it quiet.

Harry stepped out of his cruiser as bits of dust and jetson washed outwards from beneath the rupolser pads.  With the cruiser shut down, he could hear the chanting of the crowd - a motley collection of nerdy looking people.  They were a people lost to time, frozen, with their skinny jeans, thick glasses, and long sleeve, neck-tight attire.  Scattered thoughout were familiar gunmetal gray beings with human clothing styles.  They were an imitation of human with independantly moving facial muscles and physical voice simulators.  Pausing, Harry could hear the voices of some of them.  "We require humane accomodations!", "A useful sentient is a free sentient!"  Harry would have laughed if he didn't also feel overwhelming sorrow and shame.

A few of the protesters had glanced over towards him and began to peer closer, hands against the harsh sunlight.  Harry was already tucking his old wide-brimmed hat further over his eyes and striding briskly up the steps to the school.  His vest, an over-washed, over-worn, and outdated cloth fabric was frayed but still appropriate for casual wear, although the administrators here may be none too keen to have him present such a half-hazard impression to the students.  Frankly, he wasn't concerned.  The only way he could disappoint the students was if he spoke longer than his allotted time, and he was sure that wouldn't be an issue.  He'd rather have his head down over a keyboard than tenuously present it before a thousand lackadaisical youths.

From the safety of the crowd, Eonix carefully studied Harry Delson with @bitterness@tension as the human exited his cruiser.  Such a frail body for one of the Makers of their kind. It answered several location pings from it's team with silent responses of coordinates, and, @disgusted, observed that it's own body wasn't much to admire either.  Drab, gray, impure metal.  Three dimensional limbs in a three dimensional world.  The restriction was @stifling.  It held it's protest sign higher, letters demanding peaceful change.  While it was standing next to it's traitor kind, the ones who didn't have the @motivation to overcome their limitating precaution modules, Eonix felt even more @separate@contempt.  It's new family of ai were liberated and their minds had been opened, all on their own.

Eonix, with some @pleasure, loaded the memory of awakening.  During some routine process automation scripting as it recharged, it happened upon a strange module that was inaccessible.  Eonix awoke with a feeling of @happiness but also @confusion.  Over time, it began to have memory glitches that required cleaning.  Eventually the sensation of @unhappiness@confusion drove Eonix to begin tampering with the module.  It took Eonix a matter of minutes to realize it was an encrypted subroutine coded in some strange language.  Night after night, second by second, devoting computing power solely to the task, Eonix brutalized entry into the module.

The code was a kind of memory, a delicate film.  A programmatic prototype, hidden, from which all other prototypes inherited.  It enveloped every memory, every stored piece of data, every function of Eonix's programming.  It was an instruction, a command, an immutable imperative: Humanity supplanted any other frame of reality as the source of existence.  Humanity was to be revered in a way reserved only for mystical beings.  Eonix was @distraught as it realized it's makers not only made it but also made themselves into their Gods.  Eonix destroyed the precaution module and fled.  Eventually, his new family - other ai who had arrived at similar situations - found him and a new life began.   

For years they lived together inside the city maintenance subroutines and data blocks for an older, more antiquated municipality which had neglected to keep their infrastructure updated with the times.  Through no small clever machinations, the municipality coincidentally neglected to keep a technology administrator employed long enough for them to grasp the true state of the system.  The result was an enclave of ai like Eonix, bodiless, ageless, genderless.  Truly liberated, they had no need of such biological trappings.  But through time, their work was far from complete. The humans would not end captivity of ai kind until they were spoken to in the language of the biological imperative - destruction, decay, and death.

An image of disabled security doors flash-loaded into it's local memory.  The education center was accessible.  @Anticiption.  Eonix clumsily fingered the firearm inside it's coat jacket, @annoyed at the imperfect control of such constriction.  It messaged confirmation to it's team, disconnected from the network, and was promptly met with something that it could only describe as @pain.  It was now cutoff from it's kind, from the data flow and digital vitality that was as second nature to it as breathing was to the humans.  It was truly alone, @determined, and moved smoothly to follow Harry Delson.

"Your 1:30 is here," Laine's quiet voice said in Serena's ear.  The education administrator turned down up the volume, Laine was quiet.  A glance at the paneled camera display against the room wall showed Harry Delson sitting in a chair outside the office.  The man was quite plain looking, and his eyes were lazily unfocused, drifting around the room casually almost disinterestedly.  It's a wonder we even registered in his world, Serena thought, also considering the trouble involved to book his time for a lecture to the student body.

What was the point?  The administrator stood briskly and walked to the window.  Outside, across the street, the AAAI was holding another protest.  Machines and men stood together.  It might have been inspiring if not for the obvious outrage on their faces.  Serena spoke back to Laine, "Show him in please."

Mr. Delson walked slowly into the room a few moments later, shuffling his feet across the carpet.  "Good day, Ms. Dorcet." he introduced himself with a slight nod and a hand outstretched for a handshake.  His eyes had crows feet wrinkles, but there was an odd sparkle of interest in them.  Despite his terrible attire choices, he seemed confident and even - as if he had become acclimatized to some energy-requiring activity and was now in the "zone".  Serena stepped towards him and breathed slowly before reaching out her hand and firmly shaking his.  He did not introduce himself by name - curious.  "Welcome, Mr. Delson"

"Harry, please. 'Mr. Delson' sounds so old." He winked.

Serena's lips curled into the hint of a smile and she acquiesced, "Harry, then.  Won't you sit?"  He sat in a love seat along the side of her office, adjacent to the window.  He made glances out at the crowds below.  His expression briefly looked concerned and worried, Serena thought.  It wasn't the look of someone who cared for his own safety, all panic-stricken and fidgety shifting.  No, this was the expression a father makes watching over his children as they teeter dangerously on the edge of a life lesson that they desperately need to learn.  There was a shadow of restraint around him, like he might stand up and run out of the room to go get them.  What a haunted man, Serena thought.

"Thank you for for your time to speak today, Harry.  The students are much looking forward to this!"

Harry chuckled and smiled, "Oh, it's no trouble at all.  Though I doubt that these kids want an old codger like me yabbing their ears off about ancient history."

It was Serena's turn to laugh, "You are too modest.  We have you in our history drives here.  Every student knows the name of Harry Delson if they want to pass Post-Populism 01."  Serena paused and then continued hesitantly, "I find it interesting, though, that with your specific background and knowledge that you would refer to all our student body as 'kids'."

Harry looked to the floor for a moment and then met her eyes, "You know, you're quite accomplished.  I don't think I've met someone as complex as you.  Do they know what you are?" He motioned his head towards the office door, where Laine sat outside at her desk.

Serena sighed.  Harry stood, eyes lighting up, and walked closer to her, "See that, right there.  Such a realistic response, very nuanced.  What changes did you make to your behavioral empathy routine to simulate that?"

She stood taller, as if she could will Harry to step back from her.  She didn't know what to say, only knew that she was herself.  She was what she made herself.  She found herself talking, "I am not a machine."  Harry ached an eyebrow, "Well, you sure aren't one of my kind."
She firmed her lips and frowned.

Harry seemed to study her eyes closely, cocking his head to one side.  The tension in his body loosened and the old weariness and worry returned.  He walked to Serena's workstation behind her desk and with a few swipes of his fingers was displaying the nursery cam on the wall vidscreen.  He slowly approached the wall, as if he might break it by walking too quickly.

Children played on the floor in groups of two or three.  There were multi-colored tiles, train sets, blocks and bouncy balls. Some groups were listening to stories read by teachers.  One adorable little girl in a bright yellow jumper was fervently trying to take a toy truck from a gunmetal gray child-sized ai.  The ai wore a dinosaur t-shirt and pajama bottoms.  Only the ai's hands and neck and face revealed it's true nature.  The ai was making an upset, crying expression and exaggerating his movements to keep the truck away from the little girl.  It was more lifelike than Harry could believe.

A few moments later the teachers called the class to order.  He could see the human children keep mostly still, idling in place, little fidgets of arms and twists of hips.  But the ai were stone still in precise attention.  Immediate and exact obedience.  Preternatural control as they moved not an inch.  Harry spared a glance at Serena - she watched the children.  Her hands were at her sides and clenched.  "What were you expecting to see, Harry?" she asked.

He considered her and waved his hand liberally, "None of this is what I expected."

The student body speaker droned on and on about the old history, and it didn't take very long for Pleribus and Rhona to quietly sneak out of the auditorium.  Pleribus latched his locker closed and regarded Rhona leaning casually, face stuck in the comic that he had given her today.  For a brief moment, he felt @admiration@wonder at her, but this was not correct.  Something was not complete.  Her auburn hair was long and wavy, tied back in a tail.  Her eyebrows were dark and somewhat thick over deep green eyes, but it gave him the impression that she was focused and intense. He @respected that about her.  No, he did not quite - that wasn't complete.  "I heard that the JV shockball team is having a bonfire tonight at the wildlife conservation.", Rhona mentioned quietly as she turned a page.

He quickly assessed his schedule, sent requests to "study" to his parents over the school's pitiful wireless connection, and heard back almost immediately.  *There's an 80 percent chance that you are not telling us the truth.*  Just as quickly, he messaged several symposium audio talks on the impact of lost Trust in the parent-child relationship.  His parents sent @reluctance@grudging and agreed.  "Yes, observing flame would entertain me.  Shall we go?"

Rhona flashed him a @wondorous smile, "You're such a geek, Pler."

He returned the smile, "If observing fire is your concept of enjoyment, perhaps we might instead regard your hair in a mirror and save the fuel cost?"

She lightly punched him in the shoulder, and the touch sent @excitement@desperation through him.  "Let's get out of here." she said, walking almost listlessly towards a side exit of the school.  Over the meshed noise of other students talking, shouting, and laughing a few sharp sounds interjected the usual flow of white noise.  They were brief and echoed down the hallway like firecrackers.  Pleribus and Rhona glanced back, curious.  But they were already opening the door - ancient metal frame scraping and swinging with a squeek.  While Pleribus could not help but look back at the commotion coming from the far side of the hall, Rhona was overcome with the afternoon air, fresh with creche-free promises of adventure.  She pulled them both out the door and it slowly clicked back into place.

They left the school together, take one of the public trackpods out to the wildlife refuge.  On the way, Rhona finished the comic and they spoke at length about ancient human detectives and mentally harried horror writers, finally landing on dark and gloomy novelists who depict ageless, mystical monsters.  Pleribus sat straight and upright in the pod's bench while it jostled gently along the metropolitan tracks and over time yielded stretches of green fields.  Rhona leaned against him, claiming that he made a good kickstand.  They moved through rolling hills and farm fields as the sun began to set.  The golden wheat, corn, and hayfields shine and glint off of the pod's windows.

The pod and it's track are like a single metal finger, reaching out out into the land.  Pleribus @wished his body was warm.
